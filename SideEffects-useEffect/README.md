The **Counter-BehindTheScenes** project is a React application that demonstrates efficient state management and rendering optimization techniques. The main focus is on the `Counter` component, which showcases the use of hooks like `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to manage state and improve performance.

### Key Features:

1. **`Counter` Component**:
   - Displays a counter with increment and decrement functionality.
   - Uses `useState` to manage the counter value.
   - Calculates whether the initial counter value is a prime number using the `isPrime` function, optimized with `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
   - Implements `useCallback` for the increment and decrement handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.

2. **Prime Number Calculation**:
   - The `isPrime` function determines if a number is prime, logging the calculation process for debugging purposes.
   - The result is memoized using `useMemo` to avoid recalculating for the same `initialCount`.

3. **Rendering Optimization**:
   - The `Counter` component is wrapped with `memo` to prevent re-renders unless its props change.
   - The project explores whether `memo` is necessary, given the existence of a `ConfigureCounter` component designed for efficiency.

4. **UI Components**:
   - **`IconButton`**: A reusable button component with customizable icons.
   - **`CounterOutput`**: Displays the current counter value.

5. **Logging**:
   - The `log` utility is used throughout the component to track rendering and function calls for debugging and performance analysis.

### Purpose:
This project is designed to teach and demonstrate:
- How to optimize React components for performance.
- The practical use of React hooks like `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
- The impact of `memo` on component rendering.

The project is modular and focuses on clean, reusable components with a strong emphasis on performance and debugging.
