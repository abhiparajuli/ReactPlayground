Here are the short summaries of all projects under the ReactPlayground workspace:

1. **QuizProject**:
   - A React application that manages and displays a quiz. The main entry point is `App.jsx`, which imports and renders the `Header` and `Quiz` components. The quiz state is managed in `Quiz.jsx`, and the results are displayed in `Summary.jsx`.

2. **SideEffects-useEffect**:
   - A React application that demonstrates the use of side effects with the `useEffect` hook. The main entry point is `App.jsx`, which manages a list of places to visit. It uses geolocation to sort places by distance and stores selected places in local storage. The application includes components like `Places`, `Modal`, and `DeleteConfirmation`.

3. **ProjMgmt**:
   - A React project management application that allows users to create, view, and manage projects and tasks. The main entry point is `App.jsx`, which manages the state of projects and tasks. Key components include `ProjectsSidebar`, `SelectedProject`, and `NewProject`.

4. **Context-UserReducer**:
   - A React application that uses context and the `useReducer` hook to manage a shopping cart. The main entry point is `App.jsx`, which provides the cart context to the `Header` and `Shop` components. The shopping cart state is managed in `shopping-cart-context.jsx`, and the cart is displayed in `Cart.jsx` and `CartModal.jsx`.
5. **Counter-BehindTheScenes**:
   - A React application that demonstrates efficient state management and rendering optimization techniques. The main focus is on the Counter component, which showcases the use of hooks like useState, useMemo, and useCallback to manage state and improve performance.
6. **HttpRequest Project**
   - The HttpRequest project is a React application that interacts with a backend server to manage and display user places and available places. The main focus is on making HTTP requests to fetch and update data.
7. **Custom Hooks**
   - The CustomHooks project is a React application that demonstrates the use of custom hooks to manage state and side effects efficiently. The project focuses on reusable and modular components to simplify complex logic.
