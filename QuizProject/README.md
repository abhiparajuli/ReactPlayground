The Quiz Project code base is a React application structured to manage and display a quiz. The main entry point is `App.jsx`, which imports and renders the `Header` and `Quiz` components.

### Key Components:

1. **`Header.jsx`**:

   - Displays the quiz logo and title.

2. **`Quiz.jsx`**:

   - Manages the quiz state and renders questions or the summary based on the user's progress.
   - Uses `Question.jsx` to display individual questions.
   - Uses `Summary.jsx` to display the quiz results.

3. **`Question.jsx`**:

   - Displays a single question and its possible answers.
   - Uses `QuestionTimer.jsx` to manage the time for each question.
   - Uses `Answers.jsx` to display and handle answer selection.

4. **`Summary.jsx`**:
   - Displays the user's performance summary after the quiz is completed.

### Data and Configuration:

- **`questions.js`**: Contains the quiz questions and answers.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that includes the root div for rendering the React application.
- **`index.css`**: Contains the global styles for the application.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts for development and build processes.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool used in this project.

This structure ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, with clear separation of concerns between different components and functionalities.
